<h1> Columbidae </h1>

<h2 class ="fixed">
a case for pigeons and doves
</h2>

<!--<div> 
<h3 class="h3pigeon1">some words here</h3></div>-->

	<div id="div1">
	<p class="pleft">Pigeons and doves make up the <strong>Columbidae Family</strong>, which includes nearly 310 species of birds.<br><br>Smaller birds of the Columbidae Family are often called doves, while larger birds are called pigeons. </p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="dropdown2">

	<div id="div2">
	<p class="pright"> However, these names don&#8217;t exactly carry real differences. The names of dove and pigeon are often used synonymously.

	<div id="div3">
	<p class="pleft"> Pigeons are thought to be birds of darker tones with iridescent accents, while doves are thought to be adorned with white plumage.<br><br> But in reality this feather-deep division is really quite blurred, as both birds have an extensive range of colorings. </p>
	</div>

<div class="dropdown4">

	</div>
	</span>

	<div id="div4">
	<p class="pright"> Pigeons and doves are notorious for their characteristic head-bobbing and cooing. <br><br>To some this is infatuating, even endearing, while to others it is legitimately revolting. </p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="dropdown5">

	<div id="div5">
	<p class="pleft"> What is less known about these birds is that they produce milk, called &#8220;crop-milk&#8221; or &#8220;pigeon-milk&#8221;, that they feed to their young. <br><br>It isn&#8217;t available at your local market (yet?) but Intrada Creative imagined what you might look for if you're in need of <a href="https://twitter.com/IntradaCreative/status/725512461487579136">99% Pigeon Milk.</a> </p>

	<div id="div6">&#8220;
	<p class="pright">Despite the imagined divide between the pigeon and the dove, a difference persists that widely impacts how the birds are viewed and treated. </p>
	</div>

<div class="dropdown7">

	<div id="pigeon4">

	<div id="div7">
	<p class="pleft"> Put plainly by podcast 99% Invisible in their episode <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unseen-city-wonders-urban-wilderness/">&#8220;Unseen City: Wonders of the Urban Wilderness&#8221;</a>,<br><br> <strong>&#8220;At some point everything good was dove and everything bad was pigeon.&#8221; </strong> </p>

	</div>
	</span>

	<div id="div8">
	<p class="pright"> Pigeons are thought to be brainless pests and utter nuisances. Ever heard of rats with wings? <br><br> Doves, on the other hand, are widely recognized symbols of love and peace. To some the dove even represents divinity and  spiritual presence.</p>
	</div>

	</div>
	</span>

	<div id="div9">
	<p class="pleft"> It&#8217;s really a profound contrast, and to an extent it does make sense. As <strong>synanthropes</strong>, living in the middle of the spectrum of domestic and wild in close proximity to humans, and in surplus, their expansive, persistent, and often parasite-bearing presence can't be expected to be well-received. </p>

	<div id="div10">
	<p class="pright"> Pigeons are one of the only 3 birds  that are not protected by federal law, and there is an entire pigeon removal industry. <br><br> Harvard mathematics professor and postwar era song satirist even commented (eloquently, really) on this in his punchy song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhuMLpdnOjY&list=RDyhuMLpdnOjY#t=0">&#8220;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&#8221;.</a></p>

	</span>

	<div id="div11">
	<p class="pleft" >Despite existing reasons for this pigeon-aversion, pigeons have helped us more than one might first think. Perhaps of their most impressive roles has been as messengers in times of war, made possible by their extraordinary navigation abilities. They have aided in fruitful psychological research, advancing knowledge about trait inheritance, endocrinology, learning, evolution, orientation, and (of course) navigation. Not to mention pigeon racing, made possible largely by our bobbing, cooing, neighborhood flying rats. </p>

	<div id="div12">
	<p class="pright">Evidently, pigeons might not be so bad, or so different from doves, after all. <br><br>
	Might they even be, dare it be said, divine? </p>
